# Genome Wide Association Study
In this project, we explored variation in responses to a methylating agent, with the resulting publication found [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.9b00266). Conducting the data analysis for the study, I implemented a genome wide association study (GWAS) using regression modeling in R to investigate SNP related to genotoxic and cytotoxic outcomes.
